        "HG 1/144 #13 GN Arms + Gundam Exia\n\u00a0Here's a great set that includes snap-fit plastic kits of GN Arms Type E and Gundam Exia in Transam mode! Just when the Celestial Being's Mobile Suits were about to be annihilated by the new GN-X units from the three superpower nations, in comes GN Arms and pilot Lasse Aeon to the rescue! As in the show, GN Arms can switch to GN Armor mode to allow Gundam Exia to dock with it for a major boost in both speed and firepower. The weapons included with GN Armor mode are two large GN swords, two GN beam guns, and two large GN cannons. The included Gundam Exia kit is almost the same as the previously released HG Gundam Exia, with the exception of red plastic parts and red foil stickers to build it in Transam mode. A display base is included."

        "HG 1/144 #01 Gundam Exia\nSharply molded in color parts, this 1/100-scale, non-grade plastic kit of Gundam Exia can take on a wide range of poses upon completion, thanks to the use of polycaps in its joints. It's fully equipped with its signature weaponry, including a GN sword that can switch to GN sword rifle mode, and be able to be folded shoulder antennas. Not a drop of glue or paint required (although painting will improve the finished results)! A sheet of foil stickers is included for detail along with a joint part for use with Bandai's Action Base 1 to set Gundam Exia in mid-air poses."

This 1/144-scale HG model reproduces this fantastic Mobile Suit in super detail, with its distinctive, gigantic red backpack! Bandai's multi-gate molding technology allows multiple colors to be blown on a single sprue, keeping the number of sprues to a minimum (keeping costs lower, and the savings are passed on to you!). And since all the parts are molded in color, you don't need to paint the kit; since they all snap together for assembly, you don't need to glue it, either! Polycaps are included for joints, so the finished product can be posed easily. Lots of sharp customised foil and clear stickers are included for a superb finish. Don't miss out on a fantastic variant of a popular mecha!"
