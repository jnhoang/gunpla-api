Its unique design allows this model kit to be displayed alongside other \"Char\u2019s Counterattack\" MG series kits sold separately, such as the Nu Gundam Ver. Ka (BAS5055454), Sazabi Ver. Ka (BAS5055457), MG Geara Doga (BAS5055456) and Jegan (BAN230348). While having proportions faithful to the image of the MS in the file, intricate details have been added to create a dense design. A clear arm is used to display all 6 unfolded tunnels in the back of the MS and other gimmicks in the thrusters and funnels are also included. Superior color division as shown by Bandai\u2019s use of proprietary color injected plastic, allow red sections (such as the shield, sub-thrusters, and the inside of each of the verniers) to be recreated by simply assembling the kit without the use of paint. \nSet includes:\n Beam assault rifle, Beam saber, funnels x6, shield, and funnel display arms x6. Runner x16. Marking sticker sheet x1. Foil sticker sheet x1. Instruction manual x1."

It was featured in a brutal battle with Zeon remnants at Torrington Base in \u201cEpisode 4: At the Bottom of the Gravity Well\u201d and is now making its debut in the RE/100 series! The intricately detailed parts specific to the RE/100 line, such as the armor and backpack, creates an easy assembly process that anyone can enjoy. Gimmicks in the legs and waist allow for an accurate recreation of iconic firing poses as seen in the series. The Guncannon Detector\u2019s designated Beam rifle has been recreated using precise detailing down to the grenade launcher and trigger. Most notable with this kit is the included 170mm (6.7\u201d) cannon used by the Nemo units deployed at Torrington Base. You can combine this weapon with other 1/100 scale kits from the Gundam UC series such as the (BAN181594) RGM-96X Jesta and (BAN141042) MSA-003 Nemo (each sold separately). Set includes Designated Beam rifle, Beam gun, Beam cannon x2, and 170mm (6.7\u201d). Runner x12. Sticker sheet x1. Marking sticker sheet x1.
