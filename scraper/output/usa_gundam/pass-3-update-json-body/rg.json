It features an internal body frame that can be separated from the runners already assembled, meaning much less work for you to do, and amazingly precise details as well! It's molded in color for a screen-accurate appearance. The Force Silhouette's gimmicks, texture and details are carefully reproduced, complete with the wings that fold backwards. The forearm can twist on a separate axis from the elbow for a realistic range of motion, and the shoulder armor rotates independently, reducing part interference. The knee armor is also movable in conjunction with the motion of the leg; four pairs of hands are included, as are plenty of weapons. Place your order today and add this legendary Gundam to your lineup!\n[Includes]:\n\nHigh energy beam rifle\nMobile shield\nVajra beam saber (x2)\nFolding razor vs. armored knife (x2)\nSilhouette Flyer\nInterchangeable hands (x8--4 each left and right)\nRealistic decals\n\n"

True to the mission of the Real Grade line to make these larger than life characters \"real\", the RG Evangelion features intricate linked parts construction to represent the relaxation and contraction of muscle fibers resulting in a very close emulation of human-joints. The movement of the spine and shoulder blades are linked to the armor parts and follow the movement of the arms and chest, shifting as needed to prevent parts from obstructing each other. From this, realistic humanoid crouching and running poses can be re-created for EVA Unit-01. This version includes a recreation of the transport platform that launches the Eva units as well as special AT Field penetration hand parts and PET effect for AT Field. Includes Entry Plug, Pallet Rifle, 2 Progressive Knives, Umbilical Cable, and 7 types of hands in different expressions.\n"
